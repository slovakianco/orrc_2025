The quality of the organization and the geography of the region prompted the Masters Commission within the FRA to challenge the host to organize the 2024 edition of the National Championships of Mountain Running higher up in nearby Stâna de Vale. The one day meeting, including a classical 11k up&down D+470m and a 33k long trail D+1300m, was highly appreciated by the competitors who insisted for a repeat of the event in 2025. The generous contribution of the local sponsors to the after race party must have impacted greatly on the attendants request for an encore."
